cs-gpios:
  description: 'GPIOs used as chip selects. If that property is used, the number of
    chip selects will be increased automatically with max(cs-gpios, hardware chip
    selects).  So if, for example, the controller has 4 CS lines, and the cs-gpios
    looks like this   cs-gpios = <&gpio1 0 0>, <0>, <&gpio1 1 0>, <&gpio1 2 0>;  Then
    it should be configured so that num_chipselect = 4, with the following mapping   cs0
    : &gpio1 0 0   cs1 : native   cs2 : &gpio1 1 0   cs3 : &gpio1 2 0 '
